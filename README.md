## What is state transformation

State transformation converts state data into a different format.

## When to use it

Use this pattern to show, or store, data in a different format.

## What you need to get started

- The [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) should be installed
- The sample was created using [Visual Studio 2022 community edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).

## Running the sample

You can just start the API, no further configuration is required.

The booking id to invoke the transformation is `1aa6ab11-a111-4687-a6e0-cbcf403bc6a8`;

## How to implement it yourself

All that is required to implement this pattern is to copy over data from a source formation to a destination format.

MessageHandler is not used to implement this pattern.
